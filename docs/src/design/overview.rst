Overview
========

The SDP is part of the evolutionary prototype of the SKA software. This
documentation gives an overview of the current design of the SDP subsystem,
which is a partial implementation of the SDP software architecture.

The SDP software architecture, and that of the rest of the system, is described
in the `Solution Intent
<https://confluence.skatelescope.org/display/SWSI/Solution+Intent+Home>`_ in
the SKA Community Confluence (wiki). The Solution Intent contains other
information about the intended behaviour of the system, such as the high-level
requirements. It also captures the behaviour of the system as currently
implemented, including the outcome of tests against the requirements.

The SDP system is composed of a number of components. The component and connector
view describes them, and the relationships between them. The module view describes
how the components are built from software modules and how they are deployed.

More details about the components can be viewed on the :ref:`design_components` page
and for modules can be found at the :ref:`design_modules` page.
