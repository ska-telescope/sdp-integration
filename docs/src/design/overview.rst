Overview
========

The SDP is part of the evolutionary prototype of the SKA software. This
documentation gives an overview of the current design of the SDP subsystem,
which is a partial implementation of the SDP software architecture.

The SDP software architecture, and that of the rest of the system, is described
in the `Solution Intent
<https://confluence.skatelescope.org/display/SWSI/Solution+Intent+Home>`_ in
the SKA Community Confluence (wiki). The Solution Intent contains other
information about the intended behaviour of the system, such as the high-level
requirements. It also captures the behaviour of the system as currently
implemented, including the outcome of tests against the requirements.
