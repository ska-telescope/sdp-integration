Overview
========

The SDP is part of the evolutionary prototype of the SKA software. This
documentation gives an overview of the current design of the SDP subsystem,
which is a partial implementation of the SDP software architecture.

The SDP software architecture, and that of the rest of the system, is described
in the `Solution Intent
<https://confluence.skatelescope.org/display/SWSI/Solution+Intent+Home>`_ in
the SKA Community Confluence (wiki). The Solution Intent contains other
information about the intended behaviour of the system, such as the high-level
requirements. It also captures the behaviour of the system as currently
implemented, including the outcome of tests against the requirements.

The components of the SDP system are software instances, configured for and deployed
to various hardware managed by the observatory and SKA Mid and Low telescopes.
More details about the components can be viewed on the :ref:`design_components` page.

A module view shows how the system is structured as a set of code units.
The SDP software units are organized as modules. More details about this can be
found on the :ref:`design_modules` page.
