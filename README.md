# SDP Integration

This repository integrates the components of the SKA Science Data Processor
(SDP). It contains the Helm chart to launch the SDP as a subsystem of the SKA
prototype (SKAMPI).

The components are produced by the following repositories:

* [Local monitoring and control (Tango devices)](https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/sdp-lmc/)
* [Processing controller](https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/sdp-proccontrol/)
* [Helm deployer](https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/sdp-helmdeploy/)
* [Console](https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/sdp-console/)
* [Workflows and processing functions](https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/sdp-workflows-procfunc/)
